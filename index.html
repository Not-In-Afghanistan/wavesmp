        <h1>Welcome to Wave SMP</h1>
        <p>
        A team? That word is a fairy tale told to keep the weak breathing. There is no “we.” <br>
        There is only you—thrown into a pit where everything moves with hunger and everything wants you gone.<br>
        You will be stalked. You will be stripped. Your work will be erased, your progress mocked, your name spat out like it never mattered.<br>
        This world does not teach. It punishes.<br>
        It does not forgive. It remembers.<br>
        Every moment is a test designed to break you, to see if you fold, to watch you disappear like the countless failures before you.<br>
        No laws shield you. No gods answer. No mercy exists.<br>
        So stand up anyway.<br>
        Burn hesitation out of your veins. Bury fear. Suffocate doubt.<br>
        Create without permission. Take without apology. Overwrite those who stood in your way.<br>
        Turn loss into fuel. Turn pain into power.<br>
        Let them watch as you outlast, outgrow, and overtake everything they thought would stop you.<br>
        Survival is not enough.<br>
        Ascend. Enforce your will. Leave nothing untouched.<br>
        Conquest is the only language this world understands.<br>
        </p>
